# TRUESRC

**Decentralized Narrative Tracking**

TRUESRC is an open infrastructure for verifying, tracing, and understanding how narratives spread across networks.  
By combining decentralization, transparency, and cryptographic integrity, TRUESRC helps communities identify the origin, evolution, and credibility of information.

## ✨ Vision

Information moves fast.  
Truth should move faster.

TRUESRC provides tools for open collaboration where narratives can be tracked from source to distribution without relying on centralized authorities.

---

## 🚀 What TRUESRC Does

- 📌 Track where a narrative started  
- 🔄 Follow how it changes over time  
- 🧾 Preserve immutable proof of authorship  
- 🌐 Enable transparent public verification  
- 🤝 Support community-driven validation  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

TRUESRC records narrative fingerprints into decentralized infrastructure.

Each entry contains:

- Source reference  
- Timestamp  
- Author / publisher identity (optional or pseudonymous)  
- Hash / integrity proof  
- Revision or propagation history  

This allows anyone to independently audit how information evolved.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

```
User → Submit Narrative  
      → Hash & Sign  
      → Store on Decentralized Layer  
      → Publicly Verifiable Timeline
```
